There is no Question 08; it's also part of Question 07, so I jumped to folder 09.
In Question 16, append is not a function in JavaScript.
There is a mistake in Question 31. No Users: Add an if test to Exercise 28 to make sure the list of users is not empty. // Exercise number is wrong. It's 30.
If there are any mistakes in my exercise solutions or if I haven't solved a question correctly, please inform me so I can correct them. Thank you.
