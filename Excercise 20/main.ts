// Q20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
let arr1:string[]= ["France","Paris", "Marseille", "Lyon"]
let arr2:string[]= ["Japan","Tokyo", "Kyoto", "Osaka"]
let arr3:string[]=["Italy","Rome", "Venice", "Florence"]
let arr4:string[]=arr1.concat(arr2,arr3)
console.log(arr4)
console.log(arr1,arr2,arr3)
