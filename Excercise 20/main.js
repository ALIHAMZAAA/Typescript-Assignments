// Q20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var arr1 = ["France", "Paris", "Marseille", "Lyon"];
var arr2 = ["Japan", "Tokyo", "Kyoto", "Osaka"];
var arr3 = ["Italy", "Rome", "Venice", "Florence"];
var arr4 = arr1.concat(arr2, arr3);
console.log(arr4);
console.log(arr1, arr2, arr3);
